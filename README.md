# Project-using-ollama

This project is a complete AI-powered Image Caption Generator built using a React frontend and a Node.js backend.

On the frontend, the user can easily upload an image through an intuitive interface. Once the image is selected, it is sent to the backend for processing.

The backend, powered by Node.js and running locally, receives the uploaded image and passes it to Ollama, a local AI inference server. Ollama is configured with the llama3.2-vision model, which is capable of analyzing image content and generating descriptive captions.

When the backend receives the AI-generated caption from Ollama, it sends it back to the frontend. The caption is then displayed alongside the uploaded image, giving users immediate feedback.

The system is designed to run entirely locally, ensuring data privacy since no images are sent to third-party servers.
It also allows for fast response times because the AI model is executed directly on the userâ€™s machine.

Overall, the project demonstrates how to integrate frontend UI/UX, backend API communication, and local AI model inference into a seamless application that provides a real-world utility: automatically generating captions for any uploaded image.
